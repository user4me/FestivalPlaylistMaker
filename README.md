Python program that uses the Spotipy library to read in a list of artists and generates a playlist of their top 5 songs.

Example lineup.txt file is provided, any size list should work just format as one artist per line

Put lineup.txt in the same folder as the program

Run the program like so: python FestivalLister.py *username* *playlistURI*

Example: python FestivalLister.py srt252 spotify:user:srt252:playlist:3inHoNcLaV9HjNdxJwZzEi

First time it will open a browser and you will need to copy the url of the page it redirects to and paste that into the prompt

Of course you will need to set your spotify developer credentials first. 

Note - this program is not perfect but it works well enough.
